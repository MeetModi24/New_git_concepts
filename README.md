# New_git_concepts
It is an attempt to teach basic to advanced git commands through technical examples under the Kharagpur Open Source Society (KOSS) task.
The Git_Github_concepts.pdf is designed to teach git concepts in depth with simplistic images and flowcharts for those who prefer white background.
Teaching_Task.pptx is an additional option to present the task in a highlighted background.
